			Practicig HTML is fun. <em> So far </em>, we have learned <strong> HTML </strong> is a language made of tag that help us describe how we want out webpages to look. We have tried the head, title, H(heading) and paragraph tags so far. Very few people know all the tags in HTML, but that is okay beacuse we can do a lot with just basic tags. We can learn about new tags when we need them. </p>
